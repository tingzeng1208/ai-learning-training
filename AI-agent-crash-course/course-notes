without A2A, has to use /api/chat for communication between agents

with A2A, standardize using messages over HTTPS, remote agents become local agents
AgentCard,

three paint points: what agent can do: agent AgentCard
communication: Messages
Execuation: Agent excuator

                        message example: {
                          role: "user,
                          parts: [{"type":"text", "text":"..."}],
                          messageId: "123...",
                          taskId: "ABC...",
                          contextId: "XYZ..."
                        }

different types of agent work flow:

1. prompt chaining
2. routing: for tasks that can be categoried or using different models or agents for differnt tasks

n8n is a low code AI agent build framework. to run in docker:
docker run -it --rm \
 -p 5678:5678 \
 -e N8N_BASIC_AUTH_ACTIVE=true \
 -e N8N_BASIC_AUTH_USER=user \
 -e N8N_BASIC_AUTH_PASSWORD=password \
 n8nio/n8n

 for google ADK,
1. Instruction is the key
2. Error handling when you have many different agents and when they fail
3. LLM Variability, twist the configuration, especially temperature.
4. can't mix google built-in tools with custom tools, need to use the same tool type
5. User OpenRouter (fee based system) to use different models, like Claude, Gemini, etc.

for using other ai models, need open lrouter

for structured data: input_schema is too rigid, not good for use, but output_shema and output_keywords are very useful.
